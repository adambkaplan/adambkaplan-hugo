An older me, looking back to one crisis amidst multiple, present crises.

## Rose-colored glasses

Even times of tragedy can appear to have silver linings with time and distance.
My generation's historic pivot came at the end of second period gym class, as my friends gathered
their belongings for homeroom.
We watched on live TV as the World Trade Center towers imploded, nearly three thousand dying before
our very eyes.
My high school was in one of the wealthier suburbs north of New York City - many of us had parents
who worked in Lower Manhattan, some in the World Trade Center itself.
I recall only one or two students who lost a parent that day, none amongst my circle of friends.
Later we learned a
[recent alum was in one of the airplanes](https://www.espn.com/new-york/story/_/id/6934364/ten-years-chris-mello-was-killed-9-11-pain-remains-mello-family)
that crashed into the towers.

Somewhere amongst my things is a marble composition notebook my English teacher made us write in
daily.
The school year was barely two weeks in, and before 9/11/2001 I had a smattering of entries - some
earnest, others horribly forced.
That night I wrote an entry entitled, "The Darkest Day," with page after page of sorrow, fear, and
confusion.
I remember riding my bike to a point on the Long Island Sound with my friends, where we could
see the smoke burning from Ground Zero.
We sat and stared in the sunset, in full awe and disbelief.

In the aftermath I remember the true sense of unity we Americans had as a country.
George W. Bush was still a rookie president, and I like other professed Democrats had a sour taste
in my mouth from _Bush vs. Gore_ and the 2000 election fiasco.
After 9/11, I remember us ready to learn from our mistakes, and in the
[9/11 Commission Report](https://9-11commission.gov/report/) we found plenty of things to fix.
I remember us ready to stand firm in our principles, as President Bush demonstrated by
[publicly and vigorously defending Islam](https://qz.com/1074258/911-video-and-text-of-george-w-bushs-islam-and-peace-speech/)
less than two weeks after the towers fell.
I remember feeling - briefly, fleetingly - that our partisan differences didn't matter, that
America was ready and willing to come to New York's help and unleash righteous justice with our
fight against Al Qaeda.

## Seeing red (again)

Taking off these glasses 19 years later, my world is still red - red with flame.
The entirety of the
[Western United States is physically on fire](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/us/fires-oregon-california-washington.html),
fueled by climate change.
We have been marching in the streets for over three months due to the weekly onslaught of
Black lives

[our](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/crime/article245302730.html)
[police](https://www.nytimes.com/article/jacob-blake-shooting-kenosha.html).

And America is the only developed nation that continues to be ravaged by a
[global pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/opinion/covid-19-global-response.html),
the likes of which the world has not seen since the 1918 Spanish Flu.
As of this post more people have died of COVID-19 in my new home state,
[North Carolina]((https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/north-carolina-coronavirus-cases.html)),
than all total casualties on 9/11.
As a country, the US is experiencing 9/11-scale deaths from the virus every three or
four days.

There have been moments of beauty and unity, such as the
[7PM cheers](https://secretnyc.co/videos-new-yorkers-clapping-essential-workers/)
when nurses and doctors changed shifts.
On my block, proximity and frequent contact amongst "quaranteams" have blossomed or strengthened
friendships.
We've put some of the technology we have to better use with friend Zoom calls and virtual happy
hours.

But as father doing my part to keep my family safe, healthy, and educated in quarantine, I am
astounded by the ugliness and division surrounding me.
Progress on climage change
[is happening](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/09/11/solar-power-60-of-new-us-power-capacity-in-june/)
in spite of, not because of, current US policies.
We have a President and police who
[look the other way](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/02/kyle-rittenhouse-trump-defense/)
while an idolizing teen [opens fire on BLM protesters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/us/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha-shooting-video.html),
murdering two and injuring one in the process.
And the most basic public health precaution to fight COVID-19 - wearing a cloth mask - has become
an [object of partisan division](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/09/11/trump-rally-michigan-masks-social-distancing-vpx.cnn).

I don't see a country capable of uniting and sacrificing to do what is best for the greater good.

I don't see a country capable of helping states when they are in need.

I don't see, well, a country.
