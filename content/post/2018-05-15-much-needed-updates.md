Almost 6 months since my last post...so much for the "many posts" on this site.

## Site Updates

The base theme for this site - [Ananke](https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git) - has seen a full major version bump since I last updated the site.
Time to review the change log!
Thankfully there are mostly bug fixes and improvements to pagination - nothing breaking with my current configuration.

GitHub recently rolled out HTTPS support for [custom domain pages](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/), like this one!
I thought of using Cloudflare to bring HTTPS support to this site (see [previous post](/post/2017-09-26-stack-show-and-tell/#next-steps)), but now GitHub is doing all the heavy lifting for me.
Yay!

## Life Updates

My public contributions on GitHub have exploded quite a bit.
This is because I am happy to report that I have joined the [OpenShift](https://openshift.com) team at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com)!
I'm currently working with the Developer Experience team, under the leadership of [@bparees](https://github.com/bparees).
Many more contributions to come, and with time I hope to use this site to showcase the new features my team cooks up.
I also aim to focus my blog content to things OpenShift and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) related.
