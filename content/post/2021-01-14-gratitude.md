Things I am grateful for:

----

- My wife - she is still alive and fighting COVID-19.
- My kids - they have displayed astounding resilience isolating in our house for nearly two weeks.
  Especially my oldest son, who has also stepped in as my wife's de facto nurse.
- My extended family - they can't be with me for a while, but have shown their undying love over
  the phone and video chats.
- My team mates and higher-ups at Red Hat. This is twofold:
  - When my team declared, "We can't promise anything this sprint," the response was +1.

  - When my PTO turned into a leave of absence, the People Team at Red Hat ensured that my family
    and I were taken care of.
- My friends - keeping my spirits up with crude jokes, good memories, and NY bagels.
- [Pineapple on pizza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP7m1_v7tGo). At the deepest point of my panic and despair, seeing a die-hard, Italian
  New Yorker eat pineapple on pizza may have saved my life.
